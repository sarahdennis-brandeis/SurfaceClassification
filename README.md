# SurfaceClassification
A web based program for the classification of compact connected surface as sphere, tori or RP2 from a string or polygon representation.

Access the program interface through surfaceClassification.html. User interface instructions are included at the bottom of the html page. 

The html relies on all 8 other JavaScript files included.

- classify.js : classification algorithm

- circlist.js : Polygons are represented by a circular list data structure

- initFuns.js : initialization of circular lists 

- cutPaste.js : polygon operations on circular lists

- stack.js : stack memory used by the drawing window 

- draw.js : interaction with html canvas drawing window

- drawHelpers.hs : draw polygon from circular list

- htmlHelpers.js : html message box and click detection


My senior thesis (2020) from Sarah Lawrence College is included and details thoroughly how the algorithm is designed.
